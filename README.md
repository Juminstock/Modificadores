    In this project, I created a ping pong game using Rust ðŸ¦€ and WASM to display it in the web browser. To use it you must do the following steps:
  <ol>
    <li>ðŸ¥‡ First, clone this repository to your local machine.</li>
    <li>You must have Rust installed in your development environment.</li>
    <li>ðŸ¥ˆ Second, put this command in your terminal: <code>./build.sh</code></li> This command will run the build.sh file which is the executable.
    <li>ðŸ¥‰ Finally, the executable will create a link for you through port 8089, click on it so that you can view the game in the browser.</li>
  </ol>
  <p align="center">Don't forget to have fun!</p>
